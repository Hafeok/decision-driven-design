"""Validate claim files against the claim format spec (spec/claim-format.md).

Usage:
    validate-claims.py meta/seed/claims-seed.yaml     # single seed file with a claims: list
    validate-claims.py core/claims/                    # directory of per-claim YAML files
    validate-claims.py core/decisions/ --decisions     # directory of decision files (minimal checks)

The seed is a frozen pre-conversion snapshot and it FAILS these checks, by design
and not by oversight: it carries DDD-measure-06 at `established` with no falsifier,
which is the defect that produced these checks and which survived five minor
versions in canon. Run against the seed, falsifier-presence catches it on the first
try. The seed is history and is not repaired -- supersession, never rewriting -- so
its exit 1 is a true report about v4.5 and not a regression. CI validates
core/claims/ and core/decisions/ only.

Exit code 0 = valid; 1 = violations printed to stderr.
Implements format version 1. New format versions extend SUPPORTED_FORMATS
with their own rule set; claims validate against their declared version.

Two classes of finding, and the difference is a ruling rather than a taste:

  error    the claim is invalid. Exit 1. A check is error class only when its
           hit list against the existing corpus is empty or already migrated --
           a check that fires on ratified claims needs a migration plan, not a
           merge.
  warning  printed, exit unaffected. Either a rule with a known backlog, or a
           heuristic that locates candidates for a human rather than deciding.

CHECK_CLASS below is the whole of that policy, one line per check, so promoting
a check is a one-word reviewable change and never a silent one.
