# Decision-Driven Design

**The software projection of the Conservation Principle of Determination Demand** — a theory of where
determinations come from, what they cost, and which actor should make each one.

> **This repository was split (`DDD-dec-04`).** The actor-general theory now lives in the principle
> repository, [`actor-indexed-determination`](https://github.com/Hafeok/actor-indexed-determination)
> (split at tag `v5.0.0`, pin now advanced — see `graph/upstream.yaml`); *decision-driven-design* is
> its **software projection** and keeps the name. Core canon is consumed by pin, not copy — see [`graph/upstream.yaml`](graph/upstream.yaml). Falsification
> of a core claim is an issue for the principle repo; software apparatus and domain projections are

> organisation-design projections, the graph tool's claims and the program's decisions.

The framework is a **claim graph**: every claim it makes is a node with a status, evidence, and a
falsifier, stored as data and validated against a versioned schema. It remains deliberately **smaller
and better-attributed** than v3, and harder to knock down — and says exactly which of its claims are
proven, exercised, or still projected.

## Start here: the one idea

Four classical results govern how work is allocated in engineered systems — Brooks's essential
complexity, Tesler's conservation of complexity, Ashby's requisite variety, Meyer's contracts. Each
quantifies over an **actor**: the thing that makes a determination against some ground. **None of them
makes that actor explicit.** They had no reason to — for the whole history of these results there
were two kinds of determiner, a person or a program, and the gap between them was a light switch, not
a spectrum.

A third kind now exists: **non-deterministic, yet with a distribution that can be frozen by binding.**
Decision-Driven Design is what you get when you **fill in the actor slot** those results left empty —
and discover that supplying the missing parameter *changes their predictions.*

Two consequences follow, and they are the framework's core contribution:

1. **The irreducible floor of a task is a property of its *acceptance predicate*, not of the task.**
   Zero where you can check the answer; non-zero where you cannot; and *whether you can* is, in
   general, undecidable. → [`core/03-the-floor.md`](core/03-the-floor.md)

2. **Selection intensity is inversely proportional to acceptance-predicate closure.** *Training* is
   what you do when you can check the work. *Selection* is what you do when you cannot — you check the
   worker instead. This is falsifiable across professions.
   → [`core/04-actors.md`](core/04-actors.md)

And, new in 4.1: for tasks whose acceptance predicate closes, **specification demand is measurable** —
it is the Shannon entropy of the verdict, and conservation is the chain rule of entropy
([`core/09`](core/09-the-measure.md)). The measure exists exactly where the predicate closes, and
vanishes precisely at the floor.

And a prediction: **model actors outperform human actors exactly where the acceptance predicate
closes, and underperform exactly where it does not — the gap tracks *closure*, not *difficulty*.**

---

## What this is, and is not

**It is** a two-primitive theory (decisions, and the ground they are determined against), an
allocation lens (four stores: encoded, mechanically checked, judged, escaped), and an actor model
(pinning resolution, the floor-in-the-predicate, seam composition).

**It is not** a new physical law. The conservation claim is **Tesler's Law of Conservation of
Complexity, generalised** — denominated in decisions, with a fourth store (the *escaped* one Tesler
lacked) and an assurance-level bound. It has **no measurable unit**, so it is a **principle**, not a
law, and the repository says so throughout. See [`core/01-the-principle.md`](core/01-the-principle.md)
and, for the full record of what was corrected and why,
[`meta/lineage-and-limits.md`](meta/lineage-and-limits.md).

We publish the review and the retreats as first-class documents. A framework that states what it
cannot support is worth more than one that overclaims.

## Reading order

### Core — the theory (upstream)

The actor-general theory — `00` primitives through `13` delivery, the canonical term graph, and the
reproduction assets — is **canon in the principle repository**,
[`actor-indexed-determination`](https://github.com/Hafeok/actor-indexed-determination), at the tag
pinned in [`graph/upstream.yaml`](graph/upstream.yaml) (`v5.5.0` at time of writing).
It is not duplicated here. This repository pins the specific claims it depends on in
[`graph/upstream.yaml`](graph/upstream.yaml); read the theory in the principle repo's `core/`.

The load-bearing, falsifiable results — the floor is in the acceptance predicate, selection intensity
tracks predicate closure, demand is the Shannon entropy of the verdict, overflow ∩ open is the
mechanism of capacity-generated escape — all live upstream. Falsification of any of them is an issue against the principle repo, not this one.

### Apparatus — the mechanisms

Operational results that fall out of the core. Read as needed.

| Document | What it gives you |
|---|---|
| [`apparatus/encode-verify.md`](apparatus/encode-verify.md) | *Encode ground you control; verify ground you don't* — and verify on a schedule |
| [`apparatus/closure-principle.md`](apparatus/closure-principle.md) | *An actor's own output is not ground* — poisoned ground, and why Terraform can delete your database |
| [`apparatus/adversarial-ground.md`](apparatus/adversarial-ground.md) | The attack surface of an actor is its ground, not its logic — across three fields |
| [`apparatus/the-skill-floor.md`](apparatus/the-skill-floor.md) | A skill without a per-invocation verifier is floor-exposed by construction |
| [`apparatus/prefix-stability.md`](apparatus/prefix-stability.md) | A prefix is a dependency chain: Martin's SDP, the optimal ordering, and cache invalidation as a specification audit |
| [`apparatus/tool-surfaces.md`](apparatus/tool-surfaces.md) | Tools reallocate demand: exporters, resolvers, verifiers — and why class depends on the task, not the tool |
| [`apparatus/tool-contract.md`](apparatus/tool-contract.md) | What a tool must declare for a DDD-native local agent; why the harness binds tools and the model never picks them |

### Applications — the projections

The framework, denominated in a domain.

| Document | Domain |
|---|---|
| [`applications/sdlc/`](applications/sdlc/) | Software delivery — the agentic/DAG design framework (formerly the whole of v3) |
| [`applications/sdlc/production-as-ground.md`](applications/sdlc/production-as-ground.md) | Production is the only real ground; DORA read as demand; which feedback loops are waste |

### The graph — claims and decisions as data

The framework as nodes. Files are storage; the graph is the object.

| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| [`core/claims/`](core/claims/) | One YAML node per claim (`DDD-<area>-<nn>`), with status, evidence, and falsifier. Canon authority for a converted claim lives here, not in its prose |
| [`core/decisions/`](core/decisions/) | Decision nodes (`DDD-dec-NN`); the load-bearing edge is `decision --basedOn--> claim` |
| [`spec/claim-format.md`](spec/claim-format.md) | The claim schema (format version 1) and its validation rules |
| [`scripts/validate-claims.py`](scripts/validate-claims.py) | Validates `core/claims/` and `core/decisions/` against the spec |

### Meta — the honesty layer and the program

| Document | What it is |
|---|---|
| [`meta/way-of-working.md`](meta/way-of-working.md) | How work on the framework is structured: the graph model, projections, the correction loop. Governs the repo |
| [`meta/conversion-protocol.md`](meta/conversion-protocol.md) | How `core/` prose becomes claim files |
| [`meta/graph-tool-ontology.md`](meta/graph-tool-ontology.md) · [`meta/graph-tool-mvp.md`](meta/graph-tool-mvp.md) | The claim/decision ontology and the tool's MVP sketch |
| `meta/lineage-and-limits.md` (upstream) | Full attribution, corrections, retreats, and the open falsification debts — canon in the principle repo |
| [`meta/consolidated-state.md`](meta/consolidated-state.md) | Projection-local status (org, outreach, product); shared claims resolve upstream |
| [`graph/upstream.yaml`](graph/upstream.yaml) | The cross-repo pins: every upstream id this repo depends on, at a version and a status |

## What changed from v3

v3 was the agentic-design framework: decisions as the unit of work, a DAG of roles, artifacts with
schemas, backed by [`product-cli`](https://github.com/Hafeok/product-cli). **That framework is
intact** — it now lives in [`applications/sdlc/`](applications/sdlc/) as the **engineering
projection** of the general principle, which is exactly what it always was. What v4 adds is the layer
*beneath* it: the theory that explains why the DAG design works, and the actor model that says which
node each determination belongs to.

The register also changed. Following external review:

- **"Law" → "Principle."** No physical-law status without a measurable quantity (which we do not have;
  Ashby did, and even he refused the term).
- **Conservation** holds as an accounting identity *within a fixed decomposition* — re-decomposing
  *relocates* demand into the seam (a cleaner split pre-pays more into the interface contract; the
  total is invariant), so the decomposition is the highest-leverage decision. → [`core/09`](core/09-the-measure.md) §4, `DDD-measure-03`.
- **The immune-system "licensing" argument** is demoted to a suggestive parallel with known
  disanalogies; **CRISPR** is the accurate compound-platform instance.
- **The zero-floor postulate** is retreated to **the floor-in-the-predicate** result, which is
  sharper and survives the theoretical limits (Rice, inevitable model error, collective tacit
  knowledge).

## Status

This is a working specification under active revision. The strongest claims — the floor-in-the-
predicate, and *selection intensity tracks predicate closure* — are **falsifiable**, and the
conditions are stated in the documents. Live status is now in the graph: every claim carries a
status (`established` / `reported` / `projected` / `retired`) in [`core/claims/`](core/claims/).
The counting-procedure debt — a measure of governing-decision demand shown invariant — is
**paid for closing predicates** by the measure (`core/09`, `DDD-measure-01`/`02`/`06`) and marked
as a **boundary, not an open debt**, off them; the framework books its remaining debts openly
([`meta/`](meta/)).

for the SDLC projection).
