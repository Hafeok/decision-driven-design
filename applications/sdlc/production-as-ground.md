# Production Is Ground

**Location:** proposed `applications/sdlc/production-as-ground.md`. An application of the encode/verify
split (`apparatus/encode-verify.md`) and the closure principle (`apparatus/closure-principle.md`) to
software delivery, tested against the DORA research programme.

**Status: reported, partially. The correspondence with DORA's published findings is real and is
checked below, including two places the framework fails to add anything and one place it may be
wrong.** The framework was *not* validated against DORA's underlying data — that data is not public;
only aggregate findings are. This is a retrodiction check against published results, not a statistical
test, and it is presented as such.

---

**Upstream basis.** This document is part of the software projection; it builds on the
principle repo's canon (`actor-indexed-determination`). The `core/NN` references below resolve
there, pinned at a version and a status in `graph/upstream.yaml`:

<!-- ddd:ref id=term:floor -->
<!-- ddd:ref id=DDD-measure-01 -->
<!-- ddd:ref id=DDD-floor-01 -->

## 1. The claim, stated carefully

A tempting formulation is: *"you cannot know whether software works before it is in production."*
**That is too strong and the framework rejects it.** Compilers, type checkers, and test suites close
predicates. `core/03` holds: digital work with checkable predicates has zero intrinsic floor. Taken
literally, the strong claim would make nearly all software floor-exposed, which is false and would
contradict the framework's own central result.

The defensible version is about **ground**, not about knowledge:

> **Pre-production predicates close over *substitute* ground. Production predicates close over *real*
> ground. A green test suite tells you the code is correct with respect to the substitute — not with
> respect to the world.**

Which makes the gap an instance of something already named:

> **A test suite is an encoded observation of ground you do not control.** It encodes what production
> was believed to look like when the test was written. Per `encode-verify.md`, *you cannot amortise an
> observation of something you do not control* — so that belief has an expiry date and no alarm on it.

Green tests over drifted fixtures is the **poisoned ground** signature exactly
(`apparatus/closure-principle.md`): the reasoning is sound, the premises are stale, and the result is
confident and wrong.

**So the reframed claim:**

> **The gap between pre-production and production verification is the gap between your copy and the
> source of truth — and it is unbounded until you deploy.**

## 2. What DORA measures, read as demand

DORA's four keys split cleanly along the encode/verify seam:

| Metric | Read in framework terms |
|---|---|
| **Deployment frequency** | how often encoded belief is checked against real ground |
| **Change lead time** | **the interval during which encoded belief goes unverified** |
| **Change failure rate** | how often the encoded belief turns out to have been wrong |
| **Failed-deployment recovery time** | the cost of being wrong, once discovered |

Two measure the **size of the unverified gap**; two measure **what it costs when the gap contained an
error.** That is the encode/verify split, instrumented.

**And DORA's own causal story matches.** Their account of the batch-size mechanism runs: manual
pipeline steps → deploy less often → larger batches → *"feedback arriving far too late."* In framework
terms, a large batch is **a large accumulation of encoded claims about production that nobody has
checked** — unverified demand in flight. Continuous delivery's core prescription (small batches,
deployed often) is, denominated in demand: **minimise the quantity of unverified encoded belief
outstanding at any moment.**

Trunk-based development fits the same shape: a long-lived branch is a set of encoded decisions
diverging from ground that keeps moving, and the merge pain is the accumulated drift being paid at
once.

---

## 3. The finding that tests the framework

Most of §2 is retrodiction — the framework explains findings that already have explanations. **One
finding is different**, because DORA reported it as counterintuitive and the framework predicts it
directly.

**DORA (2024, and the year prior): AI adoption correlates with *worsened* software delivery
performance.** DORA's stated mechanism is **not** that AI code is poor quality. It is that **batch
size increases when AI is used** — AI makes it easier to produce more code, and larger changesets
carry more risk.

The framework says the same thing without needing to observe it:

> AI raises the rate at which **encoded belief** is produced. It does not raise the rate at which that
> belief is **verified against real ground** — that rate is set by deployment frequency, which is a
> property of the delivery system, not of the code generator.
>
> **So AI increases unverified demand in flight.** Generation capacity grew; verification capacity did
> not. The gap widens, and the framework's escape term grows with it.

This is `core/10`'s structure at the organisational scale: **production capacity outran verification
capacity, and the surplus went into the escaped store.** Not a defect in the model's output — a
mis-allocation, exactly the sort the conservation principle predicts when one store's throughput
increases and the others do not.

**The prescription follows and is non-obvious:** the fix for AI-degraded delivery performance is not
better code review or more tests against substitute ground. It is **raising the verification rate to
match the new generation rate** — deploy more often, in smaller increments, so the interval of
unverified belief does not grow. That is a claim about *where to intervene*, and it is derived rather
than observed.

---

## 4. Feedback loops as verification — and which ones are waste

DORA's prescription is *shorten the loop*. That is correct advice **given the loop is necessary**. The
framework says there is a prior move: **most loops are not necessary, and the necessary ones are a
minority.**

A feedback loop is a **verification mechanism** — an expensive one, denominated in deployment latency
and blast radius. Current practice uses it for two entirely different jobs and does not distinguish
them:

- **Discovering what the predicate *is*.** You do not yet know what "correct" means, so you ship and
  observe. Irreducible where the predicate is open.
- **Checking a predicate you already have.** You know what correct means; you simply have no cheap
  mechanical check for it, so you use the expensive one.

**The second class is waste, and it is most of them.**

> **Where the predicate closes, a feedback loop is a mechanical check you declined to build.** You are
> paying deployment latency for an answer a validator would have returned in milliseconds.

The reference case: a resource name resolved from template interpolation that exceeds a published
length limit. **The rules are published. The predicate closes. The value is computable statically.**
And yet standard practice is to discover it at deploy time — a feedback loop substituting for an
unwritten check.

### 4.1 Three tiers, not two

The tempting cut is *technical closes, user response does not*. That is nearly right, and the
exception matters:

| Class | Predicate | Where it must be verified |
|---|---|---|
| **Static technical** | **closes statically** — compiles, schema conforms, name valid, migration applies, contract holds | a **validator**. Reaching production unverified is self-inflicted. |
| **Ground-dependent technical** | **closes only over real ground** — behaviour under production load, emergent interaction across services, correctness against the actual data distribution | **progressive delivery** — real traffic, bounded blast radius |
| **User response** | **does not close** — no ground truth until observed, and the standard is non-stationary | **deploy and observe.** Irreducible. |

The middle tier is why the naive two-way cut fails. *"Does this query hold at production traffic"* is
a **technical** question whose predicate does not close statically — you can benchmark against
substitutes, but the real answer requires real load. Likewise correctness against production's actual
`P(input)`, which is `core/09`'s ground-distribution caveat arriving in practice: you do not have
production's input distribution in staging.

**And this is what progressive delivery is *for*.** Canaries and shadow traffic are not a
higher-fidelity staging. They are the verification mechanism for the middle tier — technical questions
whose predicate closes only over real ground. Which is precisely why §7's prediction has teeth:
fidelity practices improve the *substitute*, and the middle tier is where no substitute suffices.

### 4.2 The rule, and the diagnostic

> **Deploy to learn how users respond. Deploy to learn how the system behaves at real scale. Never
> deploy to learn whether the code is correct.**

Most teams route all three tiers through one channel and cannot tell them apart. Which yields a
diagnostic a team can compute from its own incident history:

> **What fraction of your change failures were tier one?**
>
> Every tier-one failure is **a validator you did not build.** Tier two and three failures are the cost
> of doing business; **tier-one failures are self-inflicted.**

### 4.3 What this predicts that "shorten the loop" does not

> **Two teams at identical deployment frequency should differ in performance according to how much of
> their decision set they have moved *out* of the feedback loop into static verification.**

Loop frequency is a **second-order** lever once you have stopped using the loop for closable
decisions. This explains the team that deploys constantly and still carries a high change failure
rate: **deployment is their primary verifier**, so every closable decision they have not encoded rides
to production to be checked there. Deploying faster discovers those errors sooner; it does not stop
manufacturing them.

*Caveat, and it is real: classifying a decision by predicate closure is `core/03`'s undecidable-in-
general problem. In practice you do not need the general solution — the abundant cases (published
rules, static constraints, schema conformance) are obvious. But the framework should not claim the
decision set can be cleanly partitioned, because it cannot.*

## 5. Where the framework adds nothing — stated plainly

**Batch size.** The batch-size result predates DORA and the framework alike. Reinertsen's queueing
arguments, and Lean batch-size theory generally, give the same prescription from a different
mechanism, and DORA cites that lineage. **The framework offers a redescription here, not an
explanation DORA lacks.** Anyone claiming otherwise is overreaching.

**Feedback latency.** "Shorten the feedback loop" is the oldest advice in the field. Restating it as
"shorten the interval of unverified encoded belief" is more precise, but it is not new guidance.

**A caution about post-hoc fit.** DORA's findings are consistent with the framework — and also with
queueing theory, Lean, and general feedback-loop arguments. **Consistency with a mature empirical
programme is weak evidence**, because many stories fit. The honest claim is *"the framework explains
why these metrics work"*, never *"the framework predicted them."* §3 is the only place the ordering
runs the other way, and even there the framework and DORA agree on the mechanism — the framework's
contribution is deriving it rather than measuring it.

---

## 6. Where the framework might be wrong

**The 2024 cluster anomaly.** For the first time, the *medium* cluster posted a **lower** change
failure rate (~10%) than the *high* cluster (~20%), breaking the usual pattern in which all four keys
move together.

A naive reading of the framework predicts these should move together — more frequent verification
against real ground should mean *both* faster delivery *and* fewer failures, since escape falls.
**The anomaly is at least a partial counterexample**, and it should be recorded rather than explained
away.

A defence is available, and it is weak enough that it should be labelled as such: change failure rate
counts failures *per deployment*, so a team deploying far more often can carry a higher per-deployment
failure rate with a lower *absolute* volume of unverified belief in flight, and a lower cost per
failure. That may be right — but it is exactly the kind of post-hoc rescue the framework has
elsewhere refused to accept, and it should not be treated as settled. **Booked as an open
discrepancy.**

---

## 7. A prediction the framework makes that DORA has not tested

For this to be more than retrofitting, the framework must say something checkable that DORA's own
account does not already imply.

**The candidate.** DORA's capability catalogue includes *test data management*, whose guidance is
essentially: make substitute ground adequate, on-demand, and non-constraining. In framework terms that
is **improving the quality of the substitute** — which reduces, but cannot eliminate, the gap between
your copy and the source of truth.

> **Prediction: practices that convert substitute ground into *real* ground should outperform
> practices that improve the substitute — and the gap should widen as the substitute's fidelity
> requirement rises.**
>
> Concretely: **progressive delivery** against real traffic (canaries, shadow traffic, feature flags
> evaluated in production, staged rollout) should predict delivery performance **more strongly** than
> test-environment fidelity practices (better fixtures, more production-like staging, richer test data
> management) — *at matched investment.*

**Why this is not obvious.** Both families reduce failure risk, and industry advice treats them as
complementary rungs on one ladder. The framework says they are **different in kind**: one shrinks the
encode/verify gap by *verifying against the source of truth*, the other shrinks it by *improving the
copy*. Per `encode-verify.md`, only the first can close it, because the second is still an encoded
observation of ground you do not control.

**How it could fail.** If test-environment fidelity predicts performance as strongly as progressive
delivery at matched investment, the substitute/real distinction is not doing the work the framework
claims, and this section is wrong. That is a real risk: fidelity practices might dominate simply
because they catch errors earlier and cheaply, which would be a straightforward economic effect the
framework does not need.

**Testability.** DORA's capability catalogue and survey instrument already cover both families. The
comparison would require access to response-level data, which is not public — so this is a prediction
offered *to* the research programme, not one this framework can settle.

## 8. What survives

- **Production is where the ground is real.** Everything earlier verifies against a copy.
- **A test suite is an encoded observation of uncontrolled ground** — with an expiry and no alarm.
- **DORA's four keys instrument the encode/verify gap**: two measure its size, two measure the cost of
  being wrong inside it.
- **Feedback loops are verification, and most are waste** (§4). Three tiers — static technical
  (should be a validator), ground-dependent technical (progressive delivery), user response
  (irreducible). *Deploy to learn how users respond; never deploy to learn whether the code is
  correct.* The diagnostic: **what fraction of your change failures were tier one?** Those are
  self-inflicted — a validator you did not build.
- **The AI finding is the framework's best case** (§3): generation capacity outran verification
  capacity, and the surplus went to escape. Derived, not observed — and it yields a specific
  intervention.
- **Batch size and feedback latency are not the framework's contributions** (§4). Cite Reinertsen and
  Lean.
- **The 2024 cluster anomaly is an open discrepancy** (§5), not a resolved one.
- **The progressive-delivery-over-fidelity prediction** (§6) is the only genuinely novel, falsifiable
  claim here — and it is offered to DORA, not settled by this document.
