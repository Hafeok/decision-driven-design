## 4.4 — Accountability, the second actor axis, and the operational layer

### Added
- core/05-accountability.md — accountability capacity as a second actor axis, independent of
  pinning resolution. Conditions (persistence, stake, sanctionability) derived from the pricing
  structure of the escaped store. Answerability and liability separated. Introduces the assurance
  tower.
- apparatus/tool-surfaces.md — tools reallocate demand; exporters / resolvers / verifiers; class is
  a property of (tool, task, consumption)
- apparatus/tool-contract.md — ground-first tool contract for local agents; the harness binds
  toolsets, the model never picks them
- applications/sdlc/production-as-ground.md — production as the only real ground; DORA read as
  demand; the three tiers of feedback loop

### Corrected
- Re-decomposition RELOCATES demand into the seam; it does not destroy it. meta/lineage §3.1 and
  meta/consolidated-state §1.4 retired to core/09 §4's position. The counterexample booked as
  strongest against conservation is resolved, not conceded.
- core/00 §6.1 — the immune floor is predicate-closure, not encoding-capacity. Capacity closes the
  encoded store only; the floor is there because the organism cannot check a novel response.
- core/01 — judgment store splits executor from accountable party.

**Still outstanding in this release** — the two patches delivered separately, not applied here:
- Closure condition generalised: "digital ground" -> "ground the actor can inspect". The floor is a
  property of the <actor, predicate> pair, which the substrate phrasing could not support.
- core/04 §1 — pinning resolution defined by where a constraint attaches. Closes the
  temperature-zero objection. Last wind and pinning mode are independent quantities.

### Renumbered
- core/05..09 shift to core/06..10 to seat accountability after the actor model.

### Results
- THE FORBIDDEN STATE WAS NOT WELL-DEFINED. A classical program reads ground and determines choices,
  so actorhood alone cannot qualify an actor for the Judgment store — otherwise a program-executed
  determination would be Judgment rather than Escaped and the forbidden state would be unreachable
  by construction.
- THE THREE CONDITIONS ARE DERIVED, NOT IMPORTED. Escape is forbidden because it is unpriced; a
  price borne by nothing is not a price (stake); the bill arrives after the act, so the bearer must
  still exist (persistence); and it must be deliverable (sanctionability).
- REVOCABILITY IS WHY THE LOOSEST-PINNED ACTOR IS THE ONE THAT CAN ANSWER. An envelope that could
  not be withdrawn could not be a stake. The property that makes an actor hardest to constrain is
  the property that makes it able to answer. Pinning by value leaves nothing to revoke.
- THE CHAIN MUST BE ATTRIBUTABLE AND TAMPER-EVIDENT, NOT INTERNALLY HELD. "Knows why it decided"
  fails on the only actor with full capacity: humans confabulate, exactly as core/03 and core/04 §3
  predict. Inversion: on the provenance condition a model with an immutable ledger can OUTPERFORM a
  human. The barrier to model accountability was never the chain; it is stake and sanctionability.
- ANSWERABILITY != LIABILITY. Strict liability is consequence without account; the blameless
  postmortem is account with liability suspended — a purchase, not a softening.
- ASSURANCE TOWER. The declaration passes 00's own admission test, so it is a governing decision;
  exogenous, it would be the forbidden state as the framework's own precondition. Descent gives
  FINITENESS; well-formedness — reaching an accountability-bearing actor — gives TERMINATION.
- THE LLM MUST NEVER PICK TOOLS (scoped — see open tension), derived rather than asserted: tool
  selection is a governing decision resolved under load with no available verifier. Harness binding
  moves it to the encoded store AND makes the open set computable before the run.
- FEEDBACK LOOPS ARE VERIFICATION, AND MOST ARE WASTE. Three tiers: static technical (should be a
  validator), ground-dependent technical (progressive delivery), user response (irreducible).
  Diagnostic: the fraction of change failures that were tier one is the fraction that was
  self-inflicted.
- THE AI/BATCH-SIZE FINDING is the framework's best external corroboration: DORA measured that AI
  adoption worsens delivery performance via increased batch size; the framework derives it —
  generation capacity outran verification capacity and the surplus went to escape.

### Booked honestly
- PROPORTIONALITY IS EXOGENOUS. The framework determines who must answer and for which
  determinations. It does NOT determine what the consequence should be.
- MODEL INCAPACITY IS CONTINGENT, NOT NECESSARY. Today's towers terminate at the OPERATOR, not the
  model. Corporate personhood is the existence proof that accountability-bearing actors can be
  manufactured.
- THE TOWER'S DESCENT ARGUMENT IS NOT LICENSED BY core/09. H(verdict) exists only where the
  acceptance predicate closes, and a tolerance declaration generally has none. The descent claim
  rests on governing-set CARDINALITY, which core/09 §1 explicitly demotes as a measure of demand.
- core/05 is entirely PROJECTED. No exercised evidence; falsifiers stated per claim.
- Batch size and feedback latency are NOT the framework's contributions (Reinertsen, Lean).
- The 2024 DORA cluster anomaly (medium CFR below high) is recorded as an OPEN DISCREPANCY, with
  the available defence explicitly labelled weak rather than accepted.
- The DORA check is retrodiction against published findings; the response-level data is not public.

### Attribution
- DORA/Forsgren-Humble-Kim and Reinertsen added to meta/lineage-and-limits.md.

## 4.3 — Prefix stability (the operational layer)

### Added
- apparatus/prefix-stability.md — a cached prefix is a dependency chain, so Martin's Stable
  Dependencies Principle governs it. Instability = expected re-derivation rate. The optimal
  ordering is Smith's rule (ascending rate/length), derived and brute-force verified.
- apparatus/assets/prefix-stability-check.py — verification, including the falsification of
  the naive ordering rule.

### Results
- THE CACHE IS A DETECTOR. An SDP violation in a prefix is simultaneously a cache defect and a
  specification defect: stable content depending on volatile content means a decision was
  encoded whose ground still moves. Invalidation telemetry is therefore automated detection of
  mislocated encoding. (Caveat: fires on the prefix only; a volatile suffix is the suffix
  working correctly.)
- COST AND QUALITY DO NOT TRADE OFF. The stable prefix IS the encoded store (core/08), and the
  lever on escape is the encode fraction (core/09). Maximising cache hit rate and minimising
  escape are therefore the same optimisation.

### Corrected
- SELECTION VS TRAINING IS TWO-FACTOR, not closure alone (core/04 §3). Closure decides whether
  training is AVAILABLE; cost decides the RATIO when it is. Openness makes training's cost
  infinite (no error signal), so selection is forced; where the predicate closes you select for
  what you decided not to PAY to train. Explains the shipped table's anomaly (surgeons: high
  closure AND brutal selection, because training cost is enormous). Sharper falsifiable form:
  two professions with comparable closure should differ in selection intensity in proportion to
  training cost. Cost proxy must be PRE-REGISTERED (time-to-competence x cost-per-unit-time x
  washout rate) or the claim is unfalsifiable.
- "Order by ascending re-derivation rate" was WRONG and is retracted. It fails whenever a
  volatile segment is long (brute force: waste 551 vs optimum 151). The correct rule is Smith's:
  ascending rate PER TOKEN. The shipped INV-6 ordering (ground -> decisions -> task) remains
  correct because in a typical prefix the two rules agree; any tool that AUTOMATES ordering must
  use the per-token form.

### Attribution
- Martin (Stable Dependencies Principle) and Smith 1956 (WSPT) added to meta/lineage-and-limits.md.

## 4.2 — The floor mechanism

### Added
- core/09-the-floor-mechanism.md — escape = overflow ∩ open (the floor, with a formula);
  p_err DERIVED from rate-distortion; the encode-fraction rule; hallucination as surfaced escape
  with a three-cause taxonomy (missing / poisoned / overflowed ground) and three different fixes
- apparatus/the-skill-floor.md — skills are specification without verification, hence floor-exposed
- core/assets/floor-mechanism.py, core/assets/perr-rate-distortion.py

### Closed
- The soft error model is no longer assumed. p_err = H_b^-1(1 - C/n), from rate-distortion.

### Attribution
- meta/lineage-and-limits.md extended with §1.8-1.11: Shannon (entropy, chain rule,
  rate-distortion), Cover & Thomas, Sims (rational inattention — capacity as an information
  channel), Ji et al. / Huang et al. (hallucination taxonomies), and Kolmogorov/MDL as the
  acknowledged alternative. core/08 and core/09 are APPLIED information theory; the mathematics
  is Shannon's and the contribution is the identification.

### Reclassified
- "Measure demand on open predicates" moved from open debt to STATED BOUNDARY. It asks for
  entropy without a random variable; measurement and closure have the same domain.

### Corrected
- The predicted context "U-curve" is retracted. The robust result is the encode-fraction rule:
  raw ground past capacity is monotonic harm; encoded decisions help on both axes. The lever is
  not context size.

## 4.1 — The measure

The measure — specification demand is verdict entropy, conservation is the chain rule
(closing-predicate case); funnel/maturation corrected to judgment-demand projections; Danish
glossary.

### Added
- **`core/07-projections.md`** — the funnel and maturation, corrected: both are **judgment-demand** (cost) projections, never *count* projections; explains the reference model's spurious feedback loops. Figures: `core/assets/projections.svg` (static), `core/assets/projections.html` (interactive).
- **`core/08-the-measure.md`** — **the formal result**: for tasks whose acceptance predicate closes, specification demand is the Shannon entropy of the verdict, and conservation is the chain rule of entropy. One identity, three conditioning variables (decomposition → seam, actor → allocation, retrieval → RAG). Reproduction scripts (stdlib-only): `core/assets/measure-toy.py`, `core/assets/measure-actor-allocation.py`, `core/assets/measure-rag.py`.
- **`i18n/ordliste-dansk.md`** — Danish glossary of the framework vocabulary.

### Changed
- **The counting-procedure debt moves from open to partially discharged.** For closing predicates, demand is measured (verdict entropy) and conservation is the chain rule — a *measured* invariant on the closing-predicate region. It remains open for open predicates, where the verdict function does not exist — the same boundary as the floor. See `meta/consolidated-state.md` §5.
- The register is unchanged: still a **principle**, not a law. `core/08` strengthens how well the principle is grounded on the closing-predicate region, but the measure exists only where the predicate closes, so the general claim remains a principle.

### Corrected
- *"A better decomposition destroys demand"* — a better decomposition *pre-pays* more demand into the seam, buying cheaper parts; the total is invariant. Nothing is destroyed; it relocates. See `core/08` §4.
- The funnel as a *count* projection — it is a *judgment-demand* (cost) projection; count is fixed by the task. See `core/07`.

### Open debts (booked, not hidden)
- The judgment/escape split: `core/08` folds escape into judgment; separating them needs an actor-capacity model — the natural next result.

## 4.0 — The theory layer, and the register correction

### Added
- **`core/`** — the actor-general theory beneath the framework:
  - `00-determination` — two primitives (decisions, ground); the admission tests; *the act is a decision*
  - `01-the-principle` — conservation of determination demand; the four stores; the principle-not-law register
  - `02-completeness` — exhaustiveness of the stores, and its definitional (non-empirical) status
  - `03-the-floor` — **the floor is in the acceptance predicate** (best original result)
  - `04-actors` — **the missing parameter**: pinning, selection-vs-training, seams, the compound
  - `05-composition` — seam-demand identity; orchestrator vs. swarm; the channel is the platform
  - `06-determination-and-intelligence` — determination ≠ intelligence; the debate is structurally undecidable
- **`apparatus/`** — encode/verify, the closure principle (poisoned ground), adversarial ground
- **`meta/`** — lineage-and-limits and consolidated-state: attribution, corrections, retreats, open debts
- Full attribution to Tesler, Ashby, Brooks, Meyer/Hoare, Saltzer/Reed/Clark, Kalman, Polanyi/Collins, Rice, Edelman & Gally

### Changed
- **The v3 framework is now the SDLC projection.** The four design docs move to `applications/sdlc/` as the *engineering projection* of the general principle. Not deprecated — repositioned.
- **"Law" → "Principle."** No physical-law status is claimed; there is no measurable unit. "Law" appears only as homage (Tesler's, Ashby's), flagged as such.
- **Conservation** restated in its defensible form: an accounting identity *within a fixed decomposition*. Re-decomposition can destroy demand, so the decomposition is the highest-leverage decision.

### Corrected (following external adversarial review)
- **Zero-floor postulate** retreated to **the floor-in-the-predicate** — bounded by Rice's theorem, inevitable model error (Xu et al.; Kalai & Vempala), and Collins's collective tacit knowledge. Determinism does not lift these (they are about decidability, not predictability).
- **The immune system** demoted from "licensing instance" to suggestive parallel with known disanalogies (negative selection is leaky, not a mechanical check; innate/adaptive is a continuum). **CRISPR** is the accurate compound-platform instance.
- **"Diversity vs. redundancy"** → **degeneracy** (Edelman & Gally 2001).
- **Poisoned-ground cross-domain unification** retreated to *a family, not one mechanism* — opposite error directions (autoimmunity vs. mimicry vs. TOCTOU) must not be conflated.
- **"There is no tacit knowledge in digital work"** retired as indefensible against Collins.

### Retired / refused
- The quantum/quark extension (fails the admission tests — the resemblance is degeneracy, a fact about many-to-one maps, not determination).
- The claim that the framework proves LLMs are (or are not) intelligent. It proves the question, as posed, is **undecidable**, and maps where a verdict could come from.

### Open debts (booked, not hidden)
- A counting procedure for governing decisions, shown invariant across two architectures — the thing that would make "conservation" measurable rather than asserted.
- An operational measure of predicate closure (proposed proxies: time-to-feedback, objectivity, stationarity).
- The selection/training ratio tested across professions (falsifiable from existing literature).
